# nf-core/rnasplice: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Preprocessing

### cat

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastq/`
  - `*.merged.fastq.gz`: If `--save_merged_fastq` is specified, concatenated FastQ files will be placed in this directory.

</details>

If multiple libraries/runs have been provided for the same sample in the input samplesheet (e.g. to increase sequencing depth) then these will be merged at the very beginning of the pipeline in order to have consistent sample naming throughout the pipeline. Please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnasplice/usage#samplesheet-input) to see how to specify these samples in the input samplesheet.

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

![MultiQC - FastQC sequence counts plot](images/mqc_fastqc_counts.png)

![MultiQC - FastQC mean quality scores plot](images/mqc_fastqc_quality.png)

![MultiQC - FastQC adapter content plot](images/mqc_fastqc_adapter.png)

> **NB:** The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads. They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

### TrimGalore

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `trimgalore/`
  - `*.fq.gz`: If `--save_trimmed` is specified, FastQ files **after** adapter trimming will be placed in this directory.
  - `*_trimming_report.txt`: Log file generated by Trim Galore!.
- `trimgalore/fastqc`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics for read 1 (*and read2 if paired-end*) **after** adapter trimming.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

[Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) is a wrapper tool around Cutadapt and FastQC to peform quality and adapter trimming on FastQ files. By default, Trim Galore! will automatically detect and trim the appropriate adapter sequence.

> **NB:** TrimGalore! will only run using multiple cores if you are able to use more than > 5 and > 6 CPUs for single- and paired-end data, respectively. The total cores available to TrimGalore! will also be capped at 4 (7 and 8 CPUs in total for single- and paired-end data, respectively) because there is no longer a run-time benefit. See [release notes](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Changelog.md#version-060-release-on-1-mar-2019) and [discussion whilst adding this logic to the nf-core/atacseq pipeline](https://github.com/nf-core/atacseq/pull/65).

## Alignment and quantification

### STAR and Salmon

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `star_salmon/`
  - `*.Aligned.out.bam`: If `--save_align_intermeds` is specified the original BAM file containing read alignments to the reference genome will be placed in this directory.
  - `*.Aligned.toTranscriptome.out.bam`: If `--save_align_intermeds` is specified the original BAM file containing read alignments to the transcriptome will be placed in this directory.
- `star_salmon/log/`
  - `*.SJ.out.tab`: File containing filtered splice junctions detected after mapping the reads.
  - `*.Log.final.out`: STAR alignment report containing the mapping results summary.
  - `*.Log.out` and `*.Log.progress.out`: STAR log files containing detailed information about the run. Typically only useful for debugging purposes.
- `star_salmon/unmapped/`
  - `*.fastq.gz`: If `--save_unaligned` is specified, FastQ files containing unmapped reads will be placed in this directory.

[STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) is a read aligner designed for splice aware mapping typical of RNA sequencing data. STAR stands for Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference, and has been shown to have high accuracy and outperforms other aligners by more than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, but it is memory intensive. Using `--aligner star_salmon` is the default alignment and quantification option.

[Salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html) from [Ocean Genomics](https://www.oceangenomics.com/) is a tool for wicked-fast transcript quantification from RNA-seq data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or de-novo assembly) in order to perform quantification. All you need to run Salmon is a FASTA file containing your reference transcripts and a set of FASTA/FASTQ/BAM file(s) containing your reads. The transcriptome-level BAM files generated by STAR are provided to Salmon for downstream quantification. You can of course also provide FASTQ files directly as input to Salmon in order to pseudo-align and quantify your data by providing the `--pseudo_aligner salmon` parameter. The results generated by the pipeline are exactly the same whether you provide BAM or FASTQ input so please see the [Salmon](#salmon) results section for more details.

The STAR section of the MultiQC report shows a bar plot with alignment rates: good samples should have most reads as *Uniquely mapped* and few *Unmapped* reads.

### STAR and featureCounts

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

-`star_featurecounts/`
  -``: 

[featureCounts](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/7/923/232889) is an accurate and fast tool which works by taking the alignment coordinates for each read and cross-referencing that to the coordinates for features described in the GTF. `featureCounts` only includes and counts those reads that map to a single location (uniquely mapping) for quantification.  

### STAR and DEXSeq Count

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

-`star_dexseqcount/`
  -``: 

[DEXSeq_Count](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html) 
This step won't be run if all of the samples in the samplesheet don't have the same FASTA and GTF reference files.

## Alignment post-processing

The pipeline has been written in a way where all the files generated downstream of the alignment are placed in the same directory as specified by `--aligner` e.g. if `--aligner star_salmon` is specified then all the downstream results will be placed in the `star_salmon/` directory. This helps with organising the directory structure and more importantly, allows the end-user to get the results from multiple aligners by simply re-running the pipeline with a different `--aligner` option along the `-resume` parameter. It also means that results won't be overwritten when resuming the pipeline and can be used for benchmarking between alignment algorithms if required.

### SAMtools

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<ALIGNER>/`
  - `<SAMPLE>.sorted.bam`: If `--save_align_intermeds` is specified the original coordinate sorted BAM file containing read alignments will be placed in this directory.
  - `<SAMPLE>.sorted.bam.bai`: If `--save_align_intermeds` is specified the BAI index file for the original coordinate sorted BAM file will be placed in this directory.
  - `<SAMPLE>.sorted.bam.csi`: If `--save_align_intermeds --bam_csi_index` is specified the CSI index file for the original coordinate sorted BAM file will be placed in this directory.
- `<ALIGNER>/samtools_stats/`
  - SAMtools `<SAMPLE>.sorted.bam.flagstat`, `<SAMPLE>.sorted.bam.idxstats` and `<SAMPLE>.sorted.bam.stats` files generated from the alignment files.

The original BAM files generated by the selected alignment algorithm are further processed with [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) to sort them by coordinate, for indexing, as well as to generate read mapping statistics.

## Other steps

### BEDTools and bedGraphToBigWig

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<ALIGNER>/bigwig/`
  - `*.forward.bigWig`: bigWig coverage file relative to genes on the forward DNA strand.
  - `*.reverse.bigWig`: bigWig coverage file relative to genes on the reverse DNA strand.

The [bigWig](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigWig.html) format is an indexed binary format useful for displaying dense, continuous data in Genome Browsers such as the [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks) and [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). This mitigates the need to load the much larger BAM files for data visualisation purposes which will be slower and result in memory issues. The bigWig format is also supported by various bioinformatics software for downstream processing such as meta-profile plotting.

## Quality control

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

## Pseudo-alignment and quantification

  - `salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv`: Matrix of gene-level raw counts across all samples.
  - `salmon.merged.gene_tpm.tsv`: Matrix of gene-level TPM values across all samples.
  - `salmon.merged.gene_counts.rds`: RDS object that can be loaded in R that contains a [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html) container with the TPM (`abundance`), estimated counts (`counts`) and transcript length (`length`) in the assays slot for genes.

  - `salmon.merged.transcript_counts.tsv`: Matrix of isoform-level raw counts across all samples.
  - `salmon.merged.transcript_tpm.tsv`: Matrix of isoform-level TPM values across all samples.
  - `salmon.merged.transcript_counts.rds`: RDS object that can be loaded in R that contains a [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html) container with the TPM (`abundance`), estimated counts (`counts`) and transcript length (`length`) in the assays slot for transcripts.

  - `lib_format_counts.json`: Number of fragments assigned, unassigned and incompatible.
  - `libParams/`: Contains the file `flenDist.txt` for the fragment length distribution.
  - `logs/`: Contains the file `salmon_quant.log` giving a record of Salmon's quantification.
  - `quant.genes.sf`: Salmon *gene-level* quantification of the sample, including feature length, effective length, TPM, and number of reads.
  - `quant.sf`: Salmon *transcript-level* quantification of the sample, including feature length, effective length, TPM, and number of reads.

As described in the [STAR and Salmon section](https://github.com/nf-core/rnasplice/blob/master/docs/output.md#star-and-salmon), you can choose to pseudo-align and quantify your data with [Salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html) by providing the `--pseudo_aligner salmon` parameter. By default, Salmon is run in addition to the standard alignment workflow defined by `--aligner`, mainly because it allows you to obtain QC metrics with respect to the genomic alignments. However, you can provide the `--skip_alignment` parameter if you would like to run Salmon in isolation.

Transcripts with large inferential uncertainty won't be assigned the exact number of reads reproducibly, every time Salmon is run. Read more about this on the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/585) and [salmon](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613) Github repos.

The [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) package is used in this pipeline to summarise the results generated by Salmon into matrices for use with downstream differential analysis packages. We use tximport with different options to summarize count and TPM quantifications at the gene- and transcript-level. Please see [#499](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/499) for discussion and links regarding which counts are suitable for different types of analysis.

According to the `txtimport` documentation you can do one of the following:

Use bias corrected counts with an offset: import all the salmon files with `tximport` and then use `DESeq2` with `dds <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi, sampleTable, ~condition)` to correct for changes to the average transcript length across samples.
Use bias corrected counts without an offset: load and use `salmon.merged.gene_counts_length_scaled.tsv` or `salmon.merged.gene_counts_scaled.tsv` directly as you would with a regular counts matrix.
Use bias uncorrected counts: load and use the `txi$counts` matrix (or `salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv`) with `DESeq2`. This does not correct for potential differential isoform usage. Alternatively, if you have 3’ tagged RNA-seq data this is the most suitable method.

**NB:** The default Salmon parameters and a k-mer size of 31 are used to create the index. As [documented here](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#preparing-transcriptome-indices-mapping-based-mode) and [discussed here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668), a k-mer size off 31 works well with reads that are 75bp or longer.

## Workflow reporting and genomes

### Reference genome files

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `genome/`
  - `*.fa`, `*.gtf`, `*.gff`, `*.bed`, `.tsv`: If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then all of the genome reference files will be placed in this directory.
- `genome/index/`
  - `star/`: Directory containing STAR indices.
  - `hisat2/`: Directory containing HISAT2 indices.
  - `rsem/`: Directory containing STAR and RSEM indices.
  - `salmon/`: Directory containing Salmon indices.

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then these will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build new indices so that you can save them somewhere locally. The index building step can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline to save disk space.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
