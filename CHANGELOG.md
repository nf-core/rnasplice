First release of nf-core/rnasplice, created with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) template.

### `Added`

Implemented pipeline:

- Merge re-sequenced FastQ files (cat)
- Read QC (FastQC)
- Adapter and quality trimming (TrimGalore)
- Alignment with STAR:
  - STAR -> Salmon
  - STAR -> featureCounts
  - STAR -> HTSeq (DEXSeq count)
- Sort and index alignments (SAMtools)
- Create bigWig coverage files (BEDTools, bedGraphToBigWig)
- Pseudo-alignment and quantification (Salmon; optional)
- Summarize QC (MultiQC)
- Differential Exon Usage (DEU):
  - HTSeq -> DEXSeq
  - featureCounts -> edgeR
  - Quantification with featureCounts or HTSeq
- Differential exon usage with DEXSeq or edgeR
  - Differential Transcript Usage (DTU):
  - Salmon -> DRIMSeq -> DEXSeq
  - Filtering with DRIMSeq
- Differential transcript usage with DEXSeq
- Event-based splicing analysis:
  - STAR -> rMATS
  - Salmon -> SUPPA2

Updated pipeline:

- Visualization of differential results with edgeR, DEXSeq, and MISO
- Contrasts specified using contrastsheet.csv
- Allow users to specify input data type and start point (e.g., fastq, genome_bam, transcript_bam, salmon_results)
- Pipeline schematic updated
